# physics-engine
This program uses simple Newtonian physics to simulate celestial bodies in space.

# Controls
## Quick Controls
- Press R to reset the system
- Press S to simulate a star-planet system (it also resets the system).

## Creating a celestial object
1. Drag your mouse to shape the object's radius and release your mouse when your done.
2. Drag your mouse to select the direction and magnitude of the object's velocity and release when done. A small magnitude will result in the object having no velocity.
3. A random-colored object with your configurations is created.

## Collisions
If two objects collide, the object will the small radius will be destroyed and the object with the larger radius will remain in the system.
